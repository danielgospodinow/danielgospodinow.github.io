<h2 id="programming--under-construction">Programming 💻 (Under construction)</h2>
<ul>
<li>love open source</li>
<li>love game dev</li>
<li>love electronics and IoT</li>
<li>love automotive tech</li>
<li>like AI</li>
<li>like computer graphics</li>
<li>love building enterprise systems</li>
<li>started my own Organization <a href="https://github.com/qbaware">Qbaware</a> in GitHub where I plan to develop my commercial projects</li>
</ul>
<p>!!! THE Projects section is deleted, mention projects here, one or two projects for every section of IT that I like - IoT, Game Dev, etc.</p>
<h4 id="how-i-started">How I Started</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been programming for a while now, I started programming in my early high school years. My first programming love spark was when I started writing World of Warcraft macros at around 15 years old which later I found out to be simple Lua scripts.</p>
<h4 id="what-i-love">What I Love</h4>
<h4 id="career">Career</h4>
<p>Since I love automotive software, in 2018 I started my career as an intern software engineer at Visteon&hellip;</p>
<p>As mentioned, I also like computer graphics and IoT, so unsurprisingly enough,</p>
<p>Currently, I work for <a href="https://www.sap.com/">SAP</a>, a German world-known multinational software corporation, a market leader in end-to-end enterprise application software, and a top cloud company with 200 million users worldwide.</p>
<h4 id="qbaware">Qbaware</h4>
<p>On the 4th of September 2020, I decided to make the first move in creating my own commecrial brand - <a href="https://github.com/qbaware">Qbaware</a>.</p>
<p>The meaning behind the name &ldquo;Qbaware&rdquo; is very simple and symbolic. The essential part is the word &ldquo;Qba&rdquo; which is a Bulgarian word used mostly in the region around my hometown that expresses an emotion of excitement, fascination, amusement. It&rsquo;s just like the word &ldquo;wow&rdquo;. Furthermore, the remaining part &ldquo;-ware&rdquo; is derived from the words <em>Software</em> and <em>Hardware</em> because I aim to deliver primarely IoT projects. So the meaning of &ldquo;Qbaware&rdquo; simply breaks down to &ldquo;Fascinating software and hardware&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The brand&rsquo;s slogan &ldquo;We inspire the future, and the future inspires us&rdquo; is derived from a slogan of my hometown Dimitrovgrad which was constructed during the Socialism period from a big group of young people who used to say &ldquo;We create the town, the town creates us&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The first project which I aim to deliver under my commercial brand is <em>Kola</em>. This is a modern and outstanding smart car solution.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="education-">Education 🎓</h2>
<h4 id="high-school">High School</h4>
<p>I attended a high school in my hometown called &ldquo;Ivan Vazov&rdquo;. There, the disciplines I loved were Programming, Physics, and Maths because I imagined how all of them can be used to build a video game. Yes, I was really into game development back then.</p>
<p>During my high school education, I&rsquo;ve attended a lot of IT academies, like Telerik and SoftUni, and IT competitions, like HSSIMI - High School Student Institute of Mathematics and Informatics and the National IT Olympiad, and I had excellent results on every single one of them. This I greatly owe to my beloved Informatics teacher - Mrs Doneva.</p>
<h4 id="university">University</h4>
<p>Later on, I continued my education in Sofia University with a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Computer Science.</p>
<p>Before Sofia University, I really considered studying abroad. I was even accepted in the University of Birmingham, UK 🇬🇧 with Computer Science, but I&rsquo;m glad that my life went in a way that didn&rsquo;t let me go abroad. My university years turned out to be among my best.</p>
<p>The Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics gave me more than I could have ever expected. Countless new opportunities, countless new skills, countless new memories, and countless new friends. I&rsquo;ve went through a lot of pain together with my colleagues, we&rsquo;re a big team and a big family.</p>
<p>Futhermore, Studentski grad, the place where mostly all students in Sofia live, and Sofia itself, gave me so many friendships, so many great memories.</p>
<p>After my Bachalor&rsquo;s, I went for a Master&rsquo;s degree in Entrepreneurship. I think that some management, marketing, finance, and entrepreneurship skills can help me a lot more in life than any other technical skills from a technical degree.</p>
<p>In the future, I&rsquo;d love to go for another Master&rsquo;s degree or even a PhD in a foreign university. Currently, I&rsquo;m considering some options like Sweden and Switzerland.</p>
<h4 id="teaching">Teaching</h4>
<p>During my fourth and last year at Sofia University, I really wanted to see what&rsquo;s like to be a teacher, so I signed up as a teaching assistant at my university for two subjects - Data Structures and Algorithms and Internet of Things. In short, I really liked it. You feel wonderful when you manage to blaze even a little spark in someone, when you get them passioned, when you get them excited. I also feel like I have the urge to continue Mrs Doneva&rsquo;s teaching practices, like a successor of hers. I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;d be happy about that.</p>
<p>For the future, I&rsquo;ve been considering some teaching opportunities in academies like Telerik or SoftUni and also in online learning platforms like Udemy, Coursera, etc.</p>
<p>Currently, I publish tech articles at my blog on Medium. I&rsquo;ve also started my own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9snRirfnj3YBwbIu8UgqzQ">YouTube channel</a> for tech tutorials.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="gaming-">Gaming 🎮</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m very passionate about gaming. I love every second I spend in gaming, but unfortunatelly I&rsquo;m slowly starting to avoind doing so because there are more important things to do in the current phase of my life.</p>
<p>I play a lot of games both on my PC and on my PlayStation.</p>
<p>Some of my favourite games are</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> ❤️</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo">Diablo III</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/16/paladins-champions-of-the-realm-review">Paladins</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/counter-strike-global-offensive">Counter-Strike</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/16/grand-theft-auto-v-review">Grand Theft Auto</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/dragon-age-inquisition-review">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also started my own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMgxTn8jHffJ9zjqykbQIiw">Youtube channel</a> for entertaining gaming videos. I&rsquo;m planning to buy myself a VR set and to play and record VR games.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="training-and-sports-">Training and Sports 🏊</h2>
<h4 id="on-a-daily-basis">On a Daily Basis</h4>
<p>At my best, I try to excercise atleast once on every two days.</p>
<p>Usually, I do street workouts and jogging.</p>
<p>My favourite jogging place is park Maritsa in Dimitrovgrad - my hometown. It&rsquo;s a big park near the river Maritsa. I often take pauses to sit by the river and just relax and purge stress.</p>
<h4 id="on-rare-occasions">On Rare Occasions</h4>
<p>I adore swimming. For me, it&rsquo;s the ultimate stress relief activity. In the past, I&rsquo;ve practiced swimming a couple of times every week. Unfortunately, as of now, I just go swimming when I have the time and opportunity to do so.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s one winter sport that I really like - skiing. I&rsquo;ve gone skiing once in my life but I really enjoyed it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="animals-">Animals 🐾</h2>
<p>I enjoy interacting with animals regardless of their kind. I especially love cats and dogs.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ltDbeII.jpg" alt="Sofi"></p>
<p>A cat named Sofi, born in Sofia, Bulgaria and adopted from there, is our chubby, fluffy, and loving family member since October 2016.</p>
<p>Unlike some cats, she has never hissed or attacked a person. If you annoy her, she&rsquo;ll just gently move away from you. Or if she doesn&rsquo;t recognize you, she&rsquo;ll just run away and hide.</p>
<p>She also doesn&rsquo;t know exactly how to meow, so she just makes a cute toy-squeezing noise.</p>
<p>I often terrorize her by doing stupid and funny things with her. But she doesn&rsquo;t mind, she loves it.</p>
<p>Fun fact: If a cat has three or more colors, it&rsquo;s definitely female.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IbLeGkh.jpg" alt="Kari"></p>
<p>From October 2020, our family expanded with a new member - Karina.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a cute little Pomeranian, however she bites like a piranha fish!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="mens-fashion-">Men&rsquo;s Fashion 👞</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m also very interested in men&rsquo;s fashion.</p>

<p>“Style is a way to say who you are without having to speak.” —Rachel Zoe</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spring and Autumn are the seasons for some of my favourite outfits.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve created myself an Instagram page called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/casualsformen">casualsformen</a> in which I gather, store and share all my favourite outfits.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="finances-">Finances 📈</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m a person who&rsquo;s very concerned about his money.</p>
<p>I try to save as much as possible without stopping myself too much from doing or buying things that I want.</p>
<p>I see topics such as investing, money management, finances, and economy as very interesting ones. Sometimes, in my free time, I educate myself in those topics through different kinds of online material.</p>
<p>I like investing in stocks and that&rsquo;s mostly what I focus on, but recently a friend of mine sparked in me a serious interest in Bitcoin and the whole crypto world.</p>
